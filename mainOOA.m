% Main code for problem solving using object oriented approach.
% Results should be the same as the ones obtained through the imperative
% approach. Therefore all tests should pass. 


%% Numerical values


%% Definition and solution of the problem

% mainGeometry contains the main information of the problem.
% articulated3Gproblem is created to actually SOLVE the problem.
problemSolver = articulated3Dproblem;
